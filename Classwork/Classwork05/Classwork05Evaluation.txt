Classwork05 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Nice to see you HAVE headers in your files, but you should fix
the stars on the right side.  Best to just remove them entirely,
and then make things line up so it all looks nice.


Your test coverage is adequate, but you can always do more to
make sure that you've tested everything, including errors that
might occur.

scores:
