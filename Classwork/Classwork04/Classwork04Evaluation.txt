Classwork03 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Sorry, Adam, but your code doesn't compile.  There are a total
of 12 compile errors when I compile both files.  There are 11
in the IntLinkedList.java file and one in the Tester.java file.
If it doesn't compile, I can't evaluate it.

scores:
=============================
IntLinkedList.java
   insertAt()                 [0 pt]
   removeAt()                 [0 pt]
IntLinkeListTester.java
   added tests to existing    [OPTIONAL 1 pt]
      won't compile, so can't give credit
headers in all files          [2 pt]
code style                    [1 pt]

total possible points         5 points
      additional credit       1 point


you got 3 out of 5 which is 60% which is a D

Make sure your code compiles in the command line, using the
command "javac <filename>.java"......
