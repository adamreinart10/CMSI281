======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Your code looks good, but make sure you are consistent with the
indenting for all files, not 2 spaces in one file and 3 in the
other.  Pretty good coverage on testing, but you only have one
test for "getMax()" and there should be five.

Still, works as advertised.  Keep up the good work!

scores:

   min 5 new tests for getMax()     [0.2 pt.]
   test[s] for noDups               [1 pt.]

you got 9.2 out of 10 which is 92% which is an A-minus
